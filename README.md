**Now, Ctrl+Backspace can delete a word backwards!** (which is already supported in most of the browsers, editors, file explorers, etc. Everywhere!)

## Compile

- Please refer to [README.GIT](/README.GIT).
- Install the dependencies, then run `./autogen.sh`.
- After that, just do the normal `./configure` and `make; make install`.

## Binary file

Here are some binary files I compiled within Docker. However, I don't guarantee they will work on YOUR machine! I suggest you compile it yourself in case something went wrong.

- [Ubuntu 18.04](/bin/ubuntu_18.04)
