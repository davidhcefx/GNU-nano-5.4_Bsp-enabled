# nano-4.8
**Now, Ctrl+Backspace can delete a word backwards!** (which is already supported in most of the browser, editor, file explorer, etc. Everywhere!)

## Compile

- Please refer to [README.GIT](/README.GIT).
- Install the dependencies, then run `./autogen.sh`.
- After that, just do the normal `./configure` and `make; make install`.

## Binary file

I attached a [binary file](/nano), but I don't guarantee it would work on YOUR machine. It has been compiled on Ubuntu 18.04.4 (amd64). I suggest you compile it yourself in case of other issues.

## Tested on

- Ubuntu 18.04
